        A great flank steak marinade like this one is important if you want a tender, juicy, flavorful steak. 
        Make sure you marinate your flank steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer if you have time. 
        This wonderful quick and easy recipe also works great when the steak is sliced and used for fajitas.

        <p> 
            Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. 
            It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: 
            Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.

        Flank Steak Marinage
    </h2>
        <p> 
            This crowd-pleasing flank steak marinade consists of the following ingredients: vegetable oil, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and ground black pepper.
            As long as you marinate the flank steak in the fridge for two to six hours, you'll have great results. 
            However, for the absolute best results, marinate overnight or up to 12 hours.
